  "text321": "The blockchain technology and cryptocurrency market, represented by Bitcoin, has now passed its 10-year milestone.

  "text292": "Vision",
  "text291": "WGbit was founded on the belief that 'let's be among the 10% that survive after the wave passes.'\nThe founding team, composed mainly of individuals from the financial industry, began focusing on fund investments in the TMT sector since 2015 and simultaneously encountered blockchain startups. At that time, the perspective of the financial sector on blockchain was often likened to the 'tulip bubble.' However, as the cryptocurrency boom surged in 2018 and Ethereum gained significant attention, the initial members of WGbit started to deeply research the Bitcoin white paper and the Ethereum ecosystem. They were impressed by the new ideas and became convinced that crypto assets would play a crucial role in the future, allowing even those without access to banking services to benefit equally.\nAs the bull market gradually cooled and prices fell, most speculators exited, leaving only less than 10% behind, and it was at this time that Bitget was officially established.\nIn contrast to the rapid growth of exchanges like FTX, the early development of Bitget was relatively quiet. If the explosive growth of FTX is compared to a 100-meter sprint, Bitget is more like a marathon runner. It is continuously evolving with a focus on user experience, product innovation, long-term thinking, and the spirit of 'authenticity' during downturns, aiming to help more people embrace cryptocurrency assets and find smarter investment methods.",
